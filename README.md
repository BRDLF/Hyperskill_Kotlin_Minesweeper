# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Minesweeper

This was the second project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a medium difficulty project. It asks the student to write a game of minesweeper.
It intends to familiarize with encapsulation and attribute access, as well as collections, with a focus on lists.

This is also the project that explained extension functions. I remember because I used them to great extent during the project.
